# Platformer

website: 18.217.54.138

We will be making a 2D platformer video game using the phaser.io library. The basic premise of the game is that you will be jumping on generated platforms to escape some imminent threat that approaches the bottom of your screen. After adding in game mechanics and features that make it fun, we may also implement a multiplayer aspect that lets multiple players play at once.
